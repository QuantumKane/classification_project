    "The goal of this project is to determine drivers that indicate if customers from Telco are more likely to leave the company and to construct a Machine Learning classification model that most accurately predicts customer churn.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Deliverables will include:\n",
    "> - A repo containing: \n",
    ">   - This report detailing the process to create this model\n",
    ">   - Files that hold functions to acquire and prep the data\n",
    ">   - A Readme.md file detailing project planning and exection, my data dictionary, and instructions for project recreation\n",
    "> - Final model created to predict if a customer will churn\n",
    "> - CSV file with customer_id, probability of churn, and prediction of churn\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Context\n",
    "Why is customer loyalty important? What is the cost of churn over time?\n",
    "According to Patrick Campbell from [ProfitWell](https://www.profitwell.com/customer-churn/analysis),\n",
    ">\"Even seemingly small, single-figure increases in churn rate \n",
    ">can quickly have a major negative effect on your company’s ability \n",
    ">to grow. What’s more, high churn rates are more likely to compound \n",
    ">over time.\""
